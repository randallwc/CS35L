Grade breakdown:
Your poornames script is graded based on the number of test cases it passes. The cases cover different scenarios to ensure that your script follows the guidelines outlined in the assignment specifications.
Your buildwords script is graded based on its runtime output. This output is compared to the expected list of Hawaiian words (the output is correct if it includes or does not include the 13 English words consisting entirely of Hawaiian letters).
Your poornames script passed 21 test cases out of 35. Your final score on the HW part of the assignment is 60.0 / 100.
Your final score on the Lab part of the assignment is 100 / 100.<br>
<h4>Assignment 4</h4>
