# Grades

| Assignment | Score | Comments |
| :-: | :-: | :- |
| Assignment 1 | 98 out of 100 | 1.6.8: probability of overflow: attempt some mathematical explanation |
| Assignment 2 | 93 out of 100 | gpg key is not stored in the authorized keys file (that is the SSH key). So could not verify signature. Also having a keylogger can get a passphrase, but passphrases on their own do not create encryption. |
| Assignment 3 | 84 out of 100 | Grade breakdown: Your poornames script is graded based on the number of test cases it passes. The cases cover different scenarios to ensure that your script follows the guidelines outlined in the assignment specifications. Your buildwords script is graded based on its runtime output. This output is compared to the expected list of Hawaiian words (the output is correct if it includes or does not include the 13 English words consisting entirely of Hawaiian letters). Your poornames script passed 21 test cases out of 35. Your final score on the HW part of the assignment is 60.0 / 100. Your final score on the Lab part of the assignment is 100 / 100. |
| Assignment 4 | 100 out of 100 | Your shuf script is graded using 23 test cases with a maximum score of 64 points.|
| Assignment 5 | 91 out of 100 | Failed Test on Memory Leaks/Errors <br> You have failed 1 cases, which results in -7 points |
| Assignment 6 | 95 out of 100 | âˆ’ 5 pts Failed Test on large input file <br> You have failed 1 cases, which results in -5 points <br> Manual Recheck <br> Large file coming from input redirection causes seg fault |
| Assignment 7 | 94 out of 100 & 54 out of 60 | [-3] randcpuid.c includes only necessary headers? <br> [-3] randlibsw.c uses function attributes? <br> Your homework is graded using 18 test cases for a total of 60 points |
