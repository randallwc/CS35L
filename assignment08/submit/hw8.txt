I entered diffutils then ran the following command to make a backup

$ git checkout -b backup
$ git add src/*.c
$ git commit -m "changed accents to apostrophies"

I then checkedout the 3.0 version of diffutils

$ git checkout 022cd5c5eb647a22a4daa5fe5cbc10af6d5a1112 -b quote

///// part 3 /////

I then installed the patch with

$ patch -p1 < ../../submit/quote-3.0-patch.txt 

===output===
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c
===end===

///// part 4 /////

I read the add-change-log-entry-other-window (C-x 4 a) man page

///// part 5 /////

I updated the ChangeLog for my patch file

$ emacs quote-3.0-patch.txt
C-x 4 a

Then I used 'git log' to check the comit

///// part 7 /////

To create the formatted patch which would remove the need
to make changes manually I ran the following command.

$ git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

'-1' make patch for 1 comit
'--stdout' outputs the patch to stdout

$ mv formatted-patch.txt ../

///// part 8 /////

$ mkdir temp_patch

I moved into the directory

$ git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/diffutils.git

I moved into diffutils and checked out a new branch patchery

$ git checkout 022cd5c5eb647a22a4daa5fe5cbc10af6d5a1112 -b patchery

Then I applied the patch

$ git am ../../formatted-patch.txt

Then made it

$ ./bootstrap

$ patch -p0 < ../diffutils-gets.diff

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check

Then I tested it

$ src/diff . -
$ src/diff --help

There were no ` in either output so it worked.

///// part 9 /////

$ make distdir

This made the directory 'diffutils-3.0.1-93d3' so I entered it
and cat the ChangeLog file

$ cat ChangeLog

This had my change log comment at the top so It worked

I relogged in with the -Y flag then cloned the repo with this command
Then I ran gitk

$ git clone git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git emacs-CS-35L

I moved into the emacs-CS-35L directory

$ gitk

===end===

My view of the merge point is that this commit was not directly merged into master after it was
committed. Then it was merged into master after other commits were done.

The windows in gitk are

Top Left: this is where the visualization of the git tree is shown

Top Right: this is where the names and emails of the people are who committed changes

Bottom Left: this is a window that shows the patch file and information about the comit

Bottom Right: this is a window that allows for easy movement in the patch file and it
	      shows the different files that will be changed by the patch file.
