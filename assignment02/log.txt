First I ran these two commands to install openssh-server and client on my computer.

$ brew install openssh

Then to check if it was installed I used

$ brew list

This showed me that it had installed openssh and its dependencies.

$ ssh-keygen

It asked for a file and you can just use the default file name by just pressing enter.
Then you enter your password.

$ ssh-copy-id -i culver@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu

It prompted me for the password seasnet and then it gave my public key to the server lnxsrv09.

$ ssh culver@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu

This allowed me to login without needing a password to the lnxsrv09.

On my mac I downloaded XQuartz and used the command 

$ ssh -X culver@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu

to connect to server 9.  Then I used the command

$ xeyes

to get a gui on my mac that would respond to mouse movements.

To test the multihopping capabilities of my setup I sshed from my mac to server 9
with the command

$ ssh-add

This is a ssh agent for mac that needs to be run for the -A command to work properly.

$ ssh -A culver@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu

$ ssh -A culver@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu

$ exit

$ exit

to leave the servers

or I could use

$ ssh -t -A culver@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu ssh -A culver@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu

$ exit

This would take me back to my home computer's terminal.
