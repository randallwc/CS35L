<h2>Laboratory: Linux and Emacs scavenger hunt</h2>

<!-- diff，在UNIX系統上的一個工具程式，它可以比較兩個檔案之間的不同。通常它被用來比較同一個檔案，在不同版本間的差異。它可以產生一個擴展名為.diff或.patch的檔案，這個檔案可以被另一個工具程式patch來使用。-->

<p>Instructions: Do this assignment on the SEASnet GNU/Linux servers
<samp>lnxsrv06</samp>, <samp>lnxsrv07</samp>,
<samp>lnxsrv09</samp>, or <samp>lnxsrv10</samp>,
with <samp>/usr/local/cs/bin</samp>
prepended to your <samp>PATH</samp>.
Use the commands that you learned in class to find
answers to these questions. Don't use a search engine like Google, and
don't ask your neighbor, don't use GitHub, etc.
If you need a hint, ask the <abbr>TA</abbr>.
When you find a new command, run it so you can see exactly how it
works. In addition to turning in the answers to these questions, turn
in a description of your session discovering them.
</p>
<p>
As you do actions, use Emacs to record your keystrokes and each answer
in plain-text files <samp>key1.txt</samp> and <samp>ans1.txt</samp>
that you will submit as part of the assignment. If you prefer, you can
record and submit
<a href='https://orgmode.org/'>Org</a> files
<samp>key1.org</samp> and <samp>ans1.org</samp> instead
of <samp>.txt</samp> files;
see <a href='https://orgmode.org/worg/'>Hello Worg</a> for Org
introductions and tutorials.

<h2>Homework: Learning to use Emacs</h2>

<!-- DELETE-ME DELETE-ME DELETE-ME -->

<ul>
 <li>Keith Waclena, <a
  href='http://www2.lib.uchicago.edu/keith/tcl-course/emacs-tutorial.html'>A
  Tutorial Introduction to GNU Emacs</a> (2009)</li>
 <li><a
  href='https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/emacs.html'>The
  Emacs editor</a>, version 26.3 (2019)</li>
 <li><a
  href='https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/eintr.html'>An
  Introduction to Programming in Emacs Lisp</a>, version 26.3 (2019)</li>
</ul>
<p>
For all the exercises, record the steps taken to accomplish the given tasks.
Use intelligent ways of answering the questions. For example, if
asked to move to the first occurrence of the word "scrumptious", do not
merely use cursor keys to move the cursor by hand; instead, use the
builtin search capabilities to find "scrumptious" quickly.
</p>
<p>
To start, download a copy of the web page you're looking at into a
file named <samp>assign1.html</samp>. You can do this
with <a href='https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/'>Wget</a>
or <a href='https://curl.haxx.se/'>curl</a>.
Use <samp><a href='http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/cp.html'>cp</a></samp>
to make three copies of this file. Call the copies
<samp>exer1.html</samp>, <samp>exer2.html</samp>, and <samp>exer3.html</samp>.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Exercise 1.1: Moving around in Emacs</h3>

<ol>
<li>Use Emacs to edit the file <samp>exer1.html</samp>.</li>
<li>Move the cursor to just after the first occurrence of the word "HTML" (all upper-case).</li>
<li>Now move the cursor to the start of the first later occurrence of the word "scavenger".</li>
<li>Now move the cursor to the start of the first later occurrence of the word "self-referential".</li>
<li>Now move the cursor to the start of the first later occurrence of the word "arro&#119;".</li>
<li>Now move the cursor to the end of the current line.</li>
<li>Now move the cursor to the beginning of the current line.</li>
<li>
Doing the above tasks with the arrow keys takes many keystrokes, or it
involves holding down keys for a long time. Can you think of a way to
do it with fewer keystrokes by using some of the commands available in
Emacs?
<li>Did you move the cursor using the arrow keys? If so, repeat the
above steps, without using the arrow keys.</li>
<li>When you are done, exit Emacs.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Exercise 1.2: Deleting text in Emacs</h3>

<ol>
<li>Use Emacs to edit the file <samp>exer2.html</samp>. The idea is to
delete its HTML comments; the resulting page should display the same
text as the original.</li>

<li>Delete the 18th line, which is an HTML comment. <samp>&lt;!-- HTML comments look like this. --&gt;</samp></li>
<li>Delete the HTML comment containing the text
"<samp>DELETE-ME DELETE-ME DELETE-ME</samp>".</li>
<li>Delete the HTML comment containing the text "<samp>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_comment#Comments</samp>".</li>
<li>There are three more HTML comments; delete them too.</li>
</ol>

<p>
Once again, try to accomplish the tasks using a small number of keystrokes.
When you are done, save the file and exit back to the command line. You can
check your work by using a browser to view <samp>exer2.html</samp>. Also,
check that you haven't deleted something that you want to keep, by using
the following command:</p>

<pre><samp><a href='https://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/'>diff</a> -u exer1.html exer2.html &gt;exer2.diff
</samp></pre>

<p>The output file <samp>exer2.diff</samp> should describe only text
that you wanted to remove. Don't remove <samp>exer2.diff</samp>;
you'll need it later.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Exercise 1.3: Inserting text in Emacs</h3>

<ol>
<li>Use Emacs to edit the file <samp>exer3.html</samp>.</li>

<li>Change the first two instances of "Assignment 1" to "Assignment 42".</li>
<li>Change the first instance of "UTF-8" to "US-ASCII".</li>
<li>Ooops! The file is not ASCII so you need to fix that. Remove every
  line containing a non-ASCII character. You can find the next
  non-ASCII character by searching for the regular
  expression <samp>[^[:ascii:]]</samp>.
<li>Insert an empty line after the first line containing
"<samp>&lt;/ol&gt;</samp>".</li>

<li>When you finish, save the text file and exit Emacs. As before,
use the <samp>diff</samp> command to check your work.</li>
</ol>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Exercise 1.4: Other editing tasks in Emacs</h3>

<p>
In addition to inserting and deleting text, there are other common tasks
that you should know, like copy and paste, search and replace, and undo.
</p>

<ol>
<li>Execute the command "<samp>cat exer2.html exer2.diff &gt;exer4.html</samp>"
to create a file <samp>exer4.html</samp> that contains a copy of <samp>exer2.html</samp> followed by a copy of <samp>exer2.diff</samp>.</li>
<li>Use Emacs to edit the file <samp>exer4.html</samp>.
The idea is to edit the file so that it looks identical
to <samp>exer1.html</samp> on a browser, but the file itself is a
little bit different internally.</li>

<li>Go to the end of the file. Copy the new lines in the last chunk
of diff output, and paste them into the correct location earlier in the file.</li>
<li>Repeat the process, until the earlier part of the file is identical
to what was in the original.</li>
<li>Delete the last part of the file, which contains the diff output.</li>
<li>&hellip; except we didn't really want to do that, so undo the deletion.</li>

<li>Turn the diff output into a comment, by surrounding it with
"<samp>&lt;!--</samp>" and "<samp>--&gt;</samp>".

<li>Now let's try some search and replaces.
Search the text document for the pattern "<samp>&lt;ol&gt;</samp>".
How many instances did you find?
Use the search and
replace function to replace them all with the final-caps
equivalent "<samp>&lt;oL&gt;</samp>".</li>

<li>Check your work with viewing <samp>exer4.html</samp> with an HTML
browser, and by running the shell command "<samp>diff -u
exer1.html exer4.html &gt;exer4.diff</samp>". The only differences
should be changes from "<samp>&lt;ol&gt;</samp>" to "<samp>&lt;oL&gt;</samp>",
and a long HTML comment at the end.</li>

</ol>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Exercise 1.5: Doing commands in Emacs</h3>

<p>
Do these tasks all within Emacs. Don't use a shell subcommand
if you can avoid it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new directory named "<samp>junk</samp>" that's right under
your home directory.</li>

<li>In that directory, create a C source file <samp>hello.c</samp>
that contains the following text. Take care to get the text exactly
right, with no trailing spaces or empty lines, with the
initial <samp>#</samp> in the leftmost column of the first line, and
with all other lines indented to match exactly as shown:

<pre><samp>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int
main (void)
{
  int c = getchar ();
  if (c &lt; 0)
    {
      if (ferror (stdin))
        perror ("stdin");
      else
        fprintf (stderr, "EOF on input\n");
      return 1;
    }
  if (putchar (c) &lt; 0 || fclose (stdout) != 0)
    {
      perror ("stdout");
      return 1;
    }
  return 0;
}
</samp></pre>
</li>

<li>Compile this file, using the Emacs <samp>M-x compile</samp> command.
</li>

<li>Run the compiled program from Emacs using the <samp>M-!</samp> command,
and put the program's output into a new Emacs
buffer named <samp>hello-out</samp>.</li>

<li>Copy this buffer's contents directly into the log that you're
maintaining for this exercise. (You <em>are</em> using Emacs to
maintain the log, aren't you?)</li>

</ol>
</section>

<section>
<h3>Exercise 1.6: Running Elisp code</h3>

<ol>
<li>Visit Emacs's <samp>*scratch*</samp> buffer.</li>

<li>In the buffer, evaluate the two constants
  <samp>most-negative-fixnum</samp> and <samp>most-positive-fixnum</samp>.
  Use <samp>C-j</samp>
  (<samp>eval-print-last-sexp</samp>) to evaluate the constants,
  and record the results that you get.
  What is a good explanation for these values?
  (Hint: convert them to hexadecimal; you can use the Emacs
  <samp>format</samp> function to do that. Type "<samp>C-h f format RET</samp>"
  to learn more about this function.)</li>

<li>In the buffer, seed the random number generator with your student
  ID as a string, dashes included. For example, if your student ID is
  123-456-789, evaluate <samp>(random
  "123-456-789")</samp>. As before, use <samp>C-j</samp>
  to evaluate the expression,
  and record the result that you get.
  You can find out more about this function with "<samp>C-h f random
  RET</samp>".</li>

<li>In the buffer, assign two random integers to the global
  variables <samp>x</samp> and <samp>y</samp>. Start by
  executing <samp>(setq x (random))</samp>. As usual,
  use <samp>C-j</samp> and record your results.</li>

<li>Compute the product <samp>p</samp> of the two variables
  by evaluating <samp>(* x y)</samp>.
  If <samp>p</samp> is negative, compute
  <samp>(logior p most-negative-fixnum)</samp>; otherwise
  compute <samp>(logand p most-positive-fixnum)</samp>.
  Call the result <samp>r</samp>. Record <samp>p</samp> and <samp>r</samp>.</li>

<li>Compare <samp>r</samp> to the mathematical product of <samp>x</samp>
  and <samp>y</samp>.
  If <samp>r</samp> is the correct mathematical answer,
  keep trying again with a different pair of random integers
  until you get an <samp>r</samp> that is not mathematically correct.</li>

<li>Are the two integers <samp>x</samp> and <samp>y</samp> truly
  random in the mathematical sense? If not, what's not random about
  them?</li>

<li>Assuming <samp>(random)</samp> is truly random, what is the
  probability that the <samp>r</samp> value mentioned above is the
  mathematically correct product of the two integers?
  Explain how you calculated this.</li>
</ol>
