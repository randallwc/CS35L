1.	What shell command uses the man program to print all the commands that have a specific word in their man page (or at least the description part of the man page)? (hint: man man)	

	man -k [argument]

2.	Where are the mv and sh programs located in the file system? List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

	$ which mv

	/usr/local/cs/bin/mv

	$ which sh

	/usr/bin/sh

	This is not accounting for the symbolic linking of each of these commands which can be found by cd into the directory then 'ls -l [sh or mv]' to find where the
	executeable is symbollically linked to because it will show a '->' in the output or a leading 'l' char in the perms.

3.	What executable programs in /usr/bin have names that are exactly two characters long and end in r, and what do they do? List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

	$ cd /usr/bin
	$ ls -l ?r
	
	-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 62688 Sep 26  2019 ar
	-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 66752 Mar 15  2019 pr
	-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 45752 Mar 15  2019 tr

	$ find -executable -name "?r"

	./tr
	./ar
	./pr

	This means there are 3 executables that are 

	tr, ar, and pr

4.	When you execute the command named by the symbolic link /usr/bin/emacs, which file actually is executed? List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

	$ cd /usr/bin/
	$ ls -l emacs

	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 23 Jan  2  2019 emacs -> /etc/alternatives/emacs

	$ cd /etc/alternatives/
	$ ls -l emacs

	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 19 Jan  2  2019 emacs -> /usr/bin/emacs-24.3

	$ cd /usr/bin/
	$ ls -l emacs-24.3

	-rwxr-xr-t 1 root root 14792792 Sep 12  2018 emacs-24.3

	This does not have a symbolic link so

	$ pwd emacs-24.3

	/usr/bin

	The file that is actually executed is 

	'/usr/bin/emacs-24.3'

5.	What is the version number of the /usr/bin/gcc program? of the plain gcc program? Why are they different programs?

	$ /usr/bin/gcc -v

	...
	gcc version 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-39) (GCC) 
	
	The version of '/usr/bin/gcc'  is 4.8.5
	
	$ gcc -v
	
	...
	gcc version 9.3.0 (GCC) 

	The version of plain gcc is 9.3.0

	They are different programs because I changed my path variable which changes the path the shell looks for gcc when I run normal gcc.

	Also they are different executeables seen with 'which gcc' vs 'which /usr/bin/gcc' and 'ls -l gcc' in the given directories.

6.	The chmod program changes permissions on a file. What does the symbolic mode u+sx,o-w mean, in terms of permissions?

	'u + sx' means the user is adding executeable access to a file ('x') and it allows for the user to set user ID upon execution ('s').

	'o-w' mean it removed the writing permissions from the the users not in gropu u or g (the other gropus).	

7.	Use the find command to find all directories modified in the last four weeks that are located under (or are the same as) the directory /usr/local/cs. List any shell commands you used to answer this question.
	
	$ cd /usr/local/cs
	$ find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28

	/usr/local/cs
	/usr/local/cs/src/git
	/usr/local/cs/src/git/RCS
	/usr/local/cs/src/coreutils
	/usr/local/cs/src/coreutils/RCS
	...

	This output was much longer, but here are the first 5 entries.
	
	$ find /usr/local/cs -type d -mtime -28 | wc

	    446     446   21685

	This means there are 446 entries.

8.	Of the files in the same directory as find, how many of them are symbolic links? List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

	$ which find

	/usr/bin/find

	$ find /usr/bin/ -type l
	
	/usr/bin/xzegrep
	/usr/bin/htxelatex
	/usr/bin/mysql_config
	/usr/bin/gpgv
	/usr/bin/lpstat
	...

	This is the first 5 entries of the output.
	
	$ find /usr/bin/ -type l | wc -l

	303

	This mean there were 303 entries.	

9.	What is the oldest regular file in the /usr/lib64 directory? Use the last-modified time to determine age. Specify the name of the file without the /usr/lib64/ prefix. Consider files whose names start with ".". List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

	$ cd /usr/lib64
	$ ls -alt

	The last entry in this list is the oldest regular file.

	It is 'librom1394.so.0.3.0'.	

10.	Where does the locale command get its data from? List any shell commands you used to answer this question.

	$ man locale

	...
       /usr/lib/locale/locale-archive
              Usual default locale archive location.

       /usr/share/i18n/locales
              Usual default path for locale definition files.
	...

	These are under the files secion of the man page for locale.

	$ man 7 locale

	This man page for locale says that locale gets it data from the environment you are in.  It uses your environment and 'LOCPATH' to get data.

11.	In Emacs, what commands have downcase in their name? List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.

	C-h a downcase

	...
	downcase-dwim                 M-x ... RET
	   Downcase words in the region, if active; if not, downcase word at
	   point.
	downcase-region               C-x C-l
	   Convert the region to lower case.  In programs, wants two
	   arguments.
	downcase-word                 M-l
	   Convert to lower case from point to end of word, moving over.
	...

	The commands are 'downcase-dwim', 'downcase-region', and 'downcase-word'.

12.	Briefly, what do the Emacs keystrokes C-M-r through C-M-v do? Can you list their actions concisely? List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.

	C-h b	get help for bindings

	C-x o	switch windows

	C-x C-c to close emacs

	C-h a [name of command] to get help with a command

	C-M-r	isearch-backward-regexp		Do incremental search backward for regular expression.	
	C-M-s	isearch-forward-regexp		Do incremental search forward for regular expression.
	C-M-t	transpose-sexps			Transpose two balanced expressions.
	C-M-u	backward-up-list		Move backward out of one level of parentheses.
	C-M-v	scroll-other-window		This scrolls in the other window you have open

13.	In more detail, what does the Emacs keystroke C-g do? List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.

	C-h b	to find the command and get a description	

	(keyboard-quit)

	Signal a 'quit' condition.
	During execution of Lisp code, this character causes a quit directly.
	
	You can use the command C-g when you are half way through writing an incorrect command and it will signal a quit and then you can restart typing your command.

14.	What does the Emacs yank function do, and how can you easily invoke it using keystrokes? List any Emacs commands you used to answer this question.

	C-h f yank	this gives a description of yank
	C-h k C-y	both give same info
	
	C-y		this is the yanking command
	
	This command is essentially a paste that pastes back in text that was killed into the kill buffer.

	It doesn't bring back deleted text, just killed text.	

15.	When looking at the directory /usr/bin, what's the difference between the output of the ls -l command, and the directory listing of the Emacs dired command? List any shell or Emacs commands you used to answer this question.

	C-h f dired
	dired is an interactive autoloaded Lisp function in 'dired.el'.

	It is bound to C-x d

	C-s dired 	search in manual

	Dired has more entries than ls -l.

	'ls -l' just lists data but 'dired' lets you use the file names and meta data to execute commands and to use those args as arguments in commands.

	Dired allows you to move fluidly (backwards and forwards) through the file manager also unlike ls.
